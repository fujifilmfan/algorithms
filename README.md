Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms, Stanford University (via Coursera)
========================================================================================================

Contents
--------

#### Week 1
\- 1-karatsuba.py - implementation of Karatsuba multiplication  
* I was a bit disappointed that I had to use string functions because I couldn't get the math functions to work out - something to revisit again  
#### Week 2
\- 2-merge_sort.py - I figured best to implement this before attempting the problem set  
\- 2-count_inversions.py - counts the number of inversions (larger numbers appearing before smaller numbers) in a large array  
\- 2-IntegerArray.txt - the array input for 2-count_inversions.py
